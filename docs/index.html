```


## Step 1: Load packages

To install the `palmerpenguins` & 'ggplot' package, execute the code in the code chunk below by clicking on the green arrow button in the top right corner. When you execute a code chunk in RMarkdown, the output will appear in the .rmd area and your console.

```{r install packages}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Once a package is installed, you can load it by running the `library()` function with the package name inside the parentheses, like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```


## Step 2: View packages

Once the package is loaded, we can view the dataset by using the View() function with the package name inside the parantheses, like this

```{r load packages}
data(penguins)
View(penguins)
```


We can also use head() function to display columns and first few rows of the dataset

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

str() and glimpse function returns the summaries of each column arranged horizontally

```{r}
str(penguins)
glimpse(penguins)
```

colnames() returns a list of column names from the dataset

```{r}
colnames(penguins)
```


## Step 3: Cleaning data

We can use `rename()`function to rename the columns, or variables, in our data. 


```{r}
rename(penguins,body_weight=body_mass_g)
```

Another handy function for summarizing data is `summarize().` We can use it to generate a wide range of summary statistics like for example, if we wanted to know what the mean for `bill_length_mm` was in this dataset, we could run the code in the chunk below

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm))
```
Here we can notice that the bill_length_mm column has null values due to which without dropping those rows first, we would not be able to perform any function on these columns. Here `drop_na().` function comes in handy which drops all the rows containing null values.


We can also use `mutate().` function to create a new variable that captures the new value of body weight when added with 20 gm

```{r}
mutate(penguins,body_weight=body_mass_g + 20)
```

## Step 4: Manipulating the data

Let's say we want to arrange the data by least bill_length to highest bill_length then we can use  the `arrange()` function : 

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  arrange(bill_length_mm)
```


`arrange()` automatically orders by ascending order, and we need to specifically tell it when to order by descending order:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  arrange(desc(bill_length_mm))
```


We can also find out the maximum and minimum bill_length without sorting the whole dataset using the `arrange()` function using the max() and min() functions below:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species,island) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(max_bl = max(bill_length_mm), mean_bl = mean(bill_length_mm) )
```

If we need to know the average bill length , then we can use the `mean().` function to calculate the average as below:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island,species) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm))
```

We can also filter out the dataset to create a new dataset that contains only the data of penguins from the island "Biscoe"

```{r}
penguins_new <- filter(penguins,island == "Biscoe")
View(penguins_new)
```


## Step 5: Visualizing data

With `R,` we can create data visualizations that are simple and easy to understand or complicated and beautiful just by changing a bit of code.One of the most commonly used visualization packages is the `ggplot2` package

To build a visualization with `ggplot2` we layer plot elements together with a `+` symbol.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +  geom_point()
```

The code above takes the `penguins` data, plots the flipper_length_mm column on the X-axis, the body_mass_g column on the Y-axis, and represents the data as a scatter plot using the `geom_point()` command.

To further add color to the scatter plot we can use `color().` function inside the geom_point function:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +  geom_point(color="purple")
```


Now, we can also use  `geom_bar` to make a bar chart:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill=species)) +  geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~species)
```


By using `facet_grid().` we can include two variables to differentiate the data:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill=species)) +  geom_bar() + facet_grid(sex~species)
```


`ggplot2` makes it easy to modify or improve our visuals. For example, if we wanted to change the color of each point so that it represented another variable, such as the species of penguins, we can change the code like this

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +  geom_point()
```

Further improving the visuals, we can add several features together such as color, shape and size to represent a variable such as species of penguins:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species, shape = species, size = species)) +  geom_point()
```

`geom_smooth().` function can be used for adding smoothed conditional means / regression line

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +  geom_smooth()
```

We can also choose to include both the smooth line as well as the scatter plot to represent the flow of the line:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +  geom_smooth() + geom_point()
```

Sometimes when we are trying to represent many different aspects of  data in a visual, it can help to separate out some of the components. For example, we could create a different plot for each type of cut. `ggplot2` makes it easy to do this with the `facet_wrap()` function

```{r}
ggplot(data= penguins,aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color=species)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~species)
```


We can also use facet_grid() which forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column faceting variables. It is most useful when we have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data= penguins,aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color=species)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(sex~species)
```
 

## Step 6: Annotating your chart 

The first step in anootating a chart will be adding a title; that is often the first thing people will pay attention to when they encounter a data visualization for the first time. To add a title, we can use  `labs()` at the end of `ggplot()` command and then input a title there.

We can also use the `subtitle`  to a `caption` which will appear in the bottom right corner 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()+ 
  labs(title=" Palmer Penguins: Body Mass VS Flipper length", subtitle="Sample of three penguin species",
  caption="Data collected by DR Froken")+
  annotate("text",x=220,y=3500,label="The Gentoos are the largest",color="purple")
```
